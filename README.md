# Pyber Challenge

## Overview of Pyber Challenge

### Purpose of this Pyber Challenge

#### The purpose of this exercise is to help V. Isualize and the other PyBer executives better understand the total weekly fares for each city type. This to understand in a summarized way how these data differ depending on the type of city and the month that is evaluated. In this way, executives could make strategic decisions for the company with a much deeper applied analysis of the data on how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.

## Pyber Challenge Results

### From the above summary DataFrame it is evident that:

#### Most rides are in Urban type cities, with 1,625 compared to less than 50% of this with Suburban cities with 625 and just under 10% with Rural cities with 125.

### Likewise, it is evident that the total number of drivers is clearly proportional to the total number of rides in each type of city, following the same behavior as the total number of rides.

#### In the same way, the total of Fares has the same behavior as the variables just studied, however now the Rural and Suburban cities are a little higher proportionally compared to the Urban cities.

#### Continuing with the aforementioned, now with the average fare per ride variables, it is clearer why than what was explained with respect to the previous variable. Well, the behavior of this variable is inversely proportional to the previous three with Urban cities obtaining the best fare per ride 24.53 USD followed by Suburban and Rural cities. This could perhaps be explained by saying that in urban cities everything is much closer or perhaps the fare per distance is lower.

#### Finally, the last variable to study was the average fare per driver, in which the same behavior of the previous variable is evident and perhaps for similar reasons, but primarily the number of total divers by type of city and the fact of the proportional percentage decrease in the total of fares de urban with respect to the other two types of cities, comparing this variable with the others.

### Another interesting analysis for the company is the one that comes from the previous graph, where everything previously said regarding the total fare variable compared between cities is evident, but also when analyzing this behavior in different months, can draw other conclusions. For example, that at the end of February there is a considerable rise in the Total Fare in all types of city and that in most weeks through the months the same behavior can be obtained in the different cities, ignoring the range that occupies each one in USD.

## Pyber Challenge Summary

### Based on the results, some of the recommendations that could be given to the CEO to address any disparities among the city types are:

#### It would be interesting to study the length in km and minutes of each of these fares to study the average fare per minute and the average fare per distance. In this way, it would be possible to understand more thoroughly what type of city is more lucrative in these terms in order to study the costs and determine in which cases the company would be making the most profit.

#### Also, it would be interesting to study in depth the month-to-month behavior for years, not only of the total fare but also of the others to understand how the industry is shaped year by year and perhaps obtain trends that would make the company known and use behaviors, such as perhaps increasing the average fare per distance in the months with fewer rides.

#### Finally, it would be recommended to use other types of graphs that summarize a greater amount of data and variables, which would allow knowing and being able to use behavior in favor of the company. For example, a graph that has the variable of total fare by city type, but instead of a line they are represented by the average fare per distance or per driver and thus more complex analyzes can be made and represented by the board to make future decisions that drive total revenue.
